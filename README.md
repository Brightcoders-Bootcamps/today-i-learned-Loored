# Today I Learned by Lalo\*

This journal has as its content the most important information about my day by day lectures. I am starting with a resume of "Clean Code" as one of our mentors told us. The content of this journal is not just React Native related, but I am also reading stuff like best practices and updates of JavaScript and its libraries. I am using in one of my applications (ConferenceApp).

## Week 0

### Thurs 23, July 2020 {Clean Code}

Today I started reading the resume for this book since it is quite long and I think I do not have that much time to read and keep working on the apps.
In the following lines I will be talking about how you can implement "good code".

1. As an introduction, basically what /Clean Code/ means is that there must be always an standar when coding so it will be less messy for newer developers to mantain the code and implement new one. This book is all about these best practices and why they are that important while working with several people or even companies.

2. When giving a name to a variable it has to be consistent and also, has to reflect the naturality of that variable. For examlpe, if you will store some data for an input you could store it in a variable called "getDataInput". In this way, your teammates or Netizens (since we are talking about open-source code) who look up at your code will be easily engaged by the names of each variable and it will give them an literal idea of what logic is beyond that variable and what it does.

   - Avoid sufixes
   - Use 'get' and 'set' for access methods
   - Use 'is' for booleans
   - Add context to the variables grouping them in classes
   - The less, the better; make the names of the variables short and so: explicit and clear
